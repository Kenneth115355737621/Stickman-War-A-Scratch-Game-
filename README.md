This project is a Scratch game where you are simulating ancient battlefield using flags as signal sender.

The game is only needing you to click on the buttons to send troops on the mission to strike your opponent down, has a variety of options.

We used a ton of variables to check the amount of troops sent, building hypothesis on the player's input, thus using this way to simulate AI fighting against you, plus when you click on the buttons to send troop, there is a castle where flags appear, they tell the main castle to send what troops are needed, and when the troops are needed. Used a lot of random input and broadcast messages within the code.
